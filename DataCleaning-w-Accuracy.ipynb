This is based on the fact that there were reported 163 deaths in the first three months of this year, which is about 53 per month, or 14 per 10 day average. However, the amount of deaths has been increasing on average, so I think that in this time frame, there will be slightly more than the past average for this year.

Perhaps Johnson is waiting until after the election to ensure the report itself doesn&amp;#39;t affect the outcome of the election. According to sources, Johnson is not mentioned in the report so there must be a different reason. Johnson does not seem to give in to pressure of any kind so I assume he will stick to his word.\\n\\n&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/doubts-over-russia-s-u-k-meddling-after-johnson-sits-on-report\"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/doubts-over-russia-s-u-k-meddling-after-johnson-sits-on-report&lt;/a&gt;</th>\n",

He should have released it 10 days after the receipt of the report, which was October 17th, &amp;quot;Downing Street sources stated that was not now expected to happen in time, claiming the sign-off process typically takes six weeks. A No 10 spokesman added: “There are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well-informed of these.” As like Trump, The parties say that Johnson will not admit there was Russian interference. &amp;quot;Labour and Scottish National party politicians accused No 10 of refusing to recognize the scale of Russian meddling.&amp;quot; The problem is Johnson will not give a good reason why he is not releasing the report, and this has all wondering why.
